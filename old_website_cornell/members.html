        <h1>Meet the Team</h3>
        <p>
          Our team is organized into three subteams: Mechanical, Software, and Steer by Wire. Each subteam is responsible for a specific aspect of the bicycle. The three subteams meet together weekly to discuss progress and future plans, and each subteam also meets separately throughout the week.

              I joined the team at the beginning of summer 2016 and worked on the front motor to help the bike balance. This past semester, I was the systems sub-team lead, during which I worked on gathering data from our various sensors and giving the balance controller the information it needs to balance. More generally I am a junior interested in robotics, mechatronics and controls. I also am in Sigma Pi fraternity on campus, and I rowed for a year for the Cornell lightweights. I enjoy playing various sports and being outside when I am not working on the bike!
